      <h4>What surprised me the most about learning core is...</h4>
      <p>
        how crucial it is in every context. what was being taught to us, and was being put on the same level almost as the code itself, are elements that are so important for every human to learn. it shows us how to be a better person, not just to others but to ourselves too. it allows us to take a moment and reflect on ourselves and to become more aware about the world around us, and how we might percieve it and/or want to address it. a lot of times life doesn't allow us to do that, we need to just keep trucking along or we need to focus more on the educational hard skills of things. i found that it was really helpful throughout foundations, learning about different mindsets and hearing about the growth mindset for the first time - just knowing these things exist helped me in my journey, because while i may not be fully committed to the growth mindset because of how i have been in a fixed one for 28 years, it helps to know different mindsets exist and we can incorporate them in.

      <h4>what are 3 things i've learned about myself because of core</h4>
      <p>
        1. the fact that i can be book smart too, not just creative like i always thought
        2. the fact that imagination is almost just as powerful as actions
        3. that one of my main strengths is empathy and how crucial that is in every day life, it isn't a weakness
      </p>
      <h4>what are the roles of value, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
      <p>
        throughout this course you would have to have the value of honesty and integrity, as it takes a lot to not copy and paste code when you're having a hard time. i think it's good to own up when something is difficult, as it shows vulnenrability and a willingness to accept that you might be struggling. empathy helps because you can understand where other people are coming from and see their perceptions of things, and that helps you to be patient. self-awareness is huge in learning, and then of course impacting your ability to programme, because you can see where your strengths and weaknesses are and how you might change these areas. 
      </p>
      <h4>what has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        i had no idea about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset. i'd heard about positive affirmations but not that i could imagine something happening and create new pathways in the brain for it to potentially occur if i was consistent with it 
      </p>
      <h4>why do you think we spend so much time focusing on core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        like i mentioned above, i believe it is crucial. we as humans lack time sometimes to develop soft skills because society pushes us to learn and develop more hard skills, and the soft skills get forgotten about. automation is occuring, and that will eventually take over. however, i don't believe it is possible for automated machines to experience and display soft skills - and it is something only humans can do. we need to enhance these soft skills and show the world that they are incredibly important and something that cannot be forgotten about and/or put into a machine. 
      </p>
      <h4>does it feel like a waste of time?</h4>
      <p>
        two words: absolutely not. while i already knew how to listen and loop as my mum is a counselor and she trained me to become a mediator/peer mentor growing up - the fact i was taught about the growth mindset and neuroplasticity during this course is priceless. even if i don't successfully flourish in this course, the idea that my brain changes based on what i feed it and if i were to imagine myself doing something is almost as good as physically doing something is incredible to me.
