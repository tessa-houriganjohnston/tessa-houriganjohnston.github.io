      <h1>welcome to my identity and values section</h1>
      <h2><i>the place where i come to reflect on who i am <b>(flaws and all)</b></i></h2>
      <h3>_________________________________________________________________</h3>
      <h4>a situation where i had an ethical decision to make.</h4>
       <p>
        an ethical decision that i had to make which still plays on my mind was a situation i was placed in by an old boss. the situation was created from an order rather than an ask, and it involved lying to a client that i had been working directly with for 5 months. i knew straight away what was being asked of me did not align with my morals and values - as i pride myself on being honest, transparent and trustworthy. when i mentally made a pro and con list, all i could see were consequences except for the only pro being my boss not being angry with me for following his direct orders. my gut screamed in every way that this ask was so wrong, because the whole thing was built on a foundation of a lie.
       </p>
       <p>
        the problem i faced now, was saying no to someone very high above me in the food chain. due to the structure of the organisation i was in, i knew i had to involve someone that was on the same level as him in the hierachy, which i did. i had explained the situation to them, and they agreed it was morally wrong and goes against the organisations core values. due to this, and from openly talking about it and facing up to what was asked of me, the man got spoken to and the actions never took place.
       </p>
      <h4>how my culture influenced my values and identity.</h4>
       <p>
        when i think of my culture, i think of my small, wonderful and chaotic family. i would describe my family as a unit, that has a strong foundation filled with love, understanding, empathy and support. my parents could not be anymore different, but despite these differences they work as a team, and provided my brother and i with everything they could, when they could. my parents would always tell my brother and i growing up "we may not be rich - but we are rich in love", and i believe that saying alone influenced my core values and identity.
       </p>
       <p>
        from this saying and my upbringing, it has allowed me to form an identity that is getting stronger with time. as more time passes, the more sure of who i am, what i want to do, where i want to be and what success looks like to me, in comparrison to younger me who felt like she consistently lived on shakey ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>(not saying i don't still experience the shake still to this day, but it's a bit less often now).</i>
       </p>
      <h4>my strengths and limitations in regards to my learning and career development.</h4>
       <p>
        when i think of myself, i visually see a two sided coin. <b><i>not because i'm two faced</i></b>, but instead because i see majority of my strengths as having another side to them which limits me, and it depends on an array of variables that determine which way the strength and/or limitation may go. for example, one of my core strengths is my empathy and listening skills. however, on the flip side of this, a lot of the time i can be <b>too</b> empathetic, and listen <b>too</b> much. while this may be good, usually it has a detrimental impact on my energy levels and my ability to look after myself, which limits me in things such as my ability to learn and work towards developing myself.
       </p>
       <p>
        so if i am going off of that perspective, my strengths are:
       </p>
      <ul>
        <li>my resilience</li>
        <li>my determination</li>
        <li>my willpower</li>
        <li>my ability to see things from other perspectives</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          however, like mentioned previously, if we were to go off of my strengths for my limitations, my limitations would be:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>negative talk if i was unable to solve something</li>
        <li>the creation of anxiety from said negative talk</li>
        <li>having the weakness to compare myself to others</li> 
        <li>to burn myself out</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          after reflecting on these strengths, i believe that all of them will help me on my learning journey. i know that these four core strengths will help me get through learning the new language of code, and will put me confidently on the career change path. however i do need to be aware of how these four strengths can also make me fall into a behavioural pattern of comparing - which would result in negativity and anxiety which would result in a negative impact on my learning.
        </p>
      <h4>an experience working with others might not have gone so great.</h4>
        <p>
          in my last career, i constantly worked with teams. these teams were almost like squads, they were made up of different employees and also included the client a lot of the time. we worked in an agile environment, and we collaborated across the organisation. working with diversity brings so much more depth and richness to problem solving and creating a fresh and different perspective. however, it can also create misalignment and tension in team situations. since we were working in an agile environment, methdologies such as kanbans, stand-ups, check-ins etc., were incredibly helpful in trying to stop blockages from happening, which would cause tension in the long run. but alas, sometimes methods cannot prevent what is destined to be, but they do help.
        </p>
        <p>
          when resistence and/or tension did arise, using these methods allowed us to unearth the problem people were experiencing, and provided them a safe platform to communicate their concerns. it allowed them to communicate it directly to the people who may be able to solve it, and if they didn't, they could ask someone they believe could. i believe these strategies, methods and tools are incredibly effective if used correctly and consistently. other strategies i would try now and why is directly talking to my peers rather than through platforms and/or other people, as it is different from a work environment that has a hierachy.
