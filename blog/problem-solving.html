      <h1>welcome to my section on problem solving</h1>
      <h2>the place where i come to explore my problems</h2>
      <h3>___________________________________________________</h3>
      <h4>once upon a time i was <b>stuck.</b></h4>
        <p>
          ...and i was <b>stuck bad.</b> the reason i was stuck? me over complicating things of course! my problems occured during majority of the JavaScript Katas - especially the first part of the built in methods section. my over complication took place as i would read the hints like a riddle, and would assume it would be a long complicated answer, rather than a very simple code, which would give me a huge brain block. to try and solve the problem i was experiencing, i googled a lot, and by a lot i mean <b>a lot a lot,</b> and i felt really frustrated and alone with it. i read messages on discord with other students having similar issues, which made me feel less alone, and then i decided to do some pseudocode. psuedocode helped a lot and allowed me to physically break down the problem and solve it step by step. these steps provided me the visual i needed to see the simplier side of things, which taught me to calm down, be kinder to myself, and to breathe whilst i learned that every problem is fixable, and it's good to address it bit by bit.

      <h4>but it's okay because there was this other time i was <b>un-stuck.</b></h4>
        <p>
          when these moments happen, it reminds you of how there is always sunshine after rain (hooray), and they come in the form of un-stuck coding moments now days it seems. with the manipulating the objects kata, i felt more confident within myself with the code this kata needed. i'm going to be honest, i wasn't 100% throughout the entire kata, i was more like 68.43% confident with a light shower of confusion and some drops of doubt - however this percentage for me definitely falls under "elegantly solved a problem". i felt like i knew the answers to the instructions provided me, and the parts i was not too sure of i googled and watched Josephs live video on how to solve it. i felt confused at the beginning of the process, then i felt better as i started getting my little "pass!" messages in the console. throughout this kata in particular, i learned that there are times you're going to know some answers, and not know some others - and that this is okay. there are so many different problem solving techniques you can use, and it's best to just give them a go rather than hide in your own head as you try to solve them. 
        </p>
      <h4>and these experiences had me <b>feeling some sort of way.</b></h4>
        <p>
          i hope i'm not alone when i say the journey so far seems to be a turbulant one. one moment im squealing from excitement and the next i swear i might dehydrate myself from shedding too many tears. this sprint was no different, with the built-in methods kata making me feel a good amount of negative vibes. however, by the end of this sprint i feel like i can confidentally say i feel more secure in my ability to ask my peers for help, googling, rubber ducky method, console.logging and a very beginner like ability to psuedocode. in contrast to this, i do not feel confident regarding the reading error messages (as to me sometimes it's too much like a riddle and freaks me out) and asking coaches for help. but i know i need to work on these two things, especially asking coaches for help. i need to push past the idea that asking for help shows weakness, when really it only shows strength and vulnerability.
